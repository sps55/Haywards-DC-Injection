# Haywards-DC-Injection
This repository contains code used to reproduce the figures in the Space Weather Paper. 
It consists of three MATLAB scripts:
1) PQ_data_analyser - Program used to analyse the power-quality readings from the transformer.
2) Analyse_sound - Program used to analyse the sound spectrum from audio readings.

These scripts require the corresponding datasets which can be obtained from the research repository. Note that the data files need to be placed in the root directory for the programs to work.
