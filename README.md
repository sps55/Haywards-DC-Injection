# Haywards-DC-Injection
This repository contains code used to reproduce the figures in the Space Weather Paper titled: High Voltage DC Active Current Injection to Simulate Geomagnetically Induced Currents. 
It consists of two MATLAB scripts:
1) PQ_data_analyser - Program used to analyse the power-quality readings from the transformer.
2) Analyse_sound - Program used to analyse the sound spectrum from audio readings.

These scripts require the corresponding datasets which can be obtained from the research repository (https://doi.org/10.26021/canterburynz.29835422.v1). Note that the data files need to be placed in the root directory for the programs to work.
